## Core Idea: Iteratively swap the annotated objectives of (x, y); replace the template with one generated from data, which then self-refines based on the similarity score between cells.

Usage:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TerryPei/Annotator.git
cd Annotator
```

Replace the API key in the prepare folder:

```bash
cd prepare
python encrypt_api_key.py
```

The APIs of OpenAI have been changed. When conducting the experiments, please reinstall the previous version '0.28.0':

```bash
pip install -U openai==0.28.0
```

One-Shot Stages:

```
python annotator.py
```

The correctly runing will output the log files like this:

Second stages:

Copy and paste the best template from the log file to generation python file, and run with 

```bash
cd generation
python run_generate_summary.py
```

The recovery evaluation score could be directly get via ```eval.py```.
